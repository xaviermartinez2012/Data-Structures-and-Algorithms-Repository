Semantics (from Ancient Greek: σημαντικός sēmantikos, "significant")[1][2] is primarily the linguistic, and also philosophical study of meaning—in language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics. It focuses on the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for, their denotation.
