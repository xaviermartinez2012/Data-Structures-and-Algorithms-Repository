Polylogism is the belief that different groups of people reason in fundamentally different ways (coined from Greek poly=many + logos=logic).[1] The term is attributed to Ludwig von Mises,[2] who claimed that it described Marxism and other social philosophies.[3] In the Misesian sense of the term, a polylogist ascribes different forms of "logic" to different groups, which may include groups based on race,[1][4] gender, class, or time period.
